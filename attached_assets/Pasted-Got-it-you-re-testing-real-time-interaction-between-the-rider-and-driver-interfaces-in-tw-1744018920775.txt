Got it — you're testing real-time interaction between the **rider** and **driver** interfaces (in two separate tabs), and updates aren't reflecting properly in the rider's view after the driver accepts the ride.

Here’s how to **fix this**:

### ✅ Step-by-Step Checklist

#### 1. **Use Real-time Backend (e.g., Firebase, Supabase, Socket.io)**
- If you're **not using real-time tools**, the frontend won't automatically update when something changes in the backend.
- You need something like:
  - **Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore**
  - **Supabase Realtime**
  - **Socket.io** (for websockets)
  - **Polling** (less efficient, see below)

#### 2. **Ensure Database Write is Successful**
- Check that when the driver accepts the ride, the database is updated **with ride status = accepted** or similar.

#### 3. **Implement Listener in Rider's Tab**
- In the **rider's frontend code**, you should be listening for changes:
  - If using Firebase: `onSnapshot()` for Firestore or `on()` for Realtime DB
  - If using Supabase: `supabase.channel().on('postgres_changes', ...)`
  - If using Socket.io: `socket.on('rideAccepted', ...)`
- This lets the rider’s tab **instantly know** the driver has accepted the ride.

#### 4. **Trigger UI Update**
- When your listener catches the update, update the **rider's UI**:
  ```js
  // Pseudo-code
  if (ride.status === "accepted") {
    showDriverInfo();
  }
  ```

### 🛠️ Temporary Alternative (Polling)
If you're **not using real-time tools yet**, you can do **polling**:

```js
setInterval(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('/api/rides/current');
  const ride = await res.json();
  if (ride.status === 'accepted') {
    updateUI();
  }
}, 3000); // Every 3 seconds
```

### 🔍 Debugging Tips

- Open **DevTools > Network tab** in both tabs — see if requests/responses are being sent/received.
- Add `console.log()` where:
  - The ride is being accepted
  - The rider tab checks for status
- Confirm your frontend is **re-fetching or listening** correctly.
